        <p>I was born in the smallest country on mainland Africa called The Gambia. Growing up in an academic family, I always had the inclination to study Sciecne or Engineering. In  high school, I was admitted to the Science field, where I studies Physics, Math, Chemistry and Biology. Upon graduating from high school, I was moved to the Univesity of Louisiana at Monroe to study Aviation. After one year at ULM, I transferred to Highline College but this time studying Engineering, in which I obtained my AS degree. 
        After obtaining my AS degree, I transferred to Purdue Univeristy-West Lafayette to continue my degree in Electrical Engineering with an expectd graduation date of May 2020. I love Engineering and Science and always curios when I see new technologies. Currently, I am take a break from Purdue an attending Univeristy of Washington certificate program in Full Stack Development.</p>
